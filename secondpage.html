  <h2>Story:</h2>
  <p>
      <span>I’m dreaming. I’m in my basement, but of course it looks nothing like my basement in real life.</span>
      <span><br>I have no sense of time, I don’t know what season it is, what month, what time of day, nothing.</span>
      <span><br>The only light is emanating from two light bulbs hanging from the ceiling, which is only two or three feet above my head.</span>
      <span><br>I’m focused on is the never ending hallway going off into the distance in front of me, with doors only on the ride side going on forever.</span>
      <span><br>Strangely, there’s a random stack of wet wooden planks on my left. On my right is a locked pantry and behind me is a wall.</span>
      <span><br>A t rex pokes its head out of the first door in the hallway.</span>
  </p>

<span><br>Videos count as artwork right? Well then shameless self-promotion. Here's the video I made for the film festival hosted by the Motus boys!</span>
